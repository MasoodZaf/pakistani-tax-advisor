## Tax Calculation Formulas (FBR 2025-26)

### Normal Income Tax (Exact Excel Formula)

```javascript
if (taxableIncome > 0) {
  if (taxableIncome > 600000 && taxableIncome <= 1200000) {
    normalIncomeTax = (taxableIncome - 600000) * 0.05;
  } else if (taxableIncome > 1200000 && taxableIncome <= 2200000) {
    normalIncomeTax = (taxableIncome - 1200000) * 0.15 + 30000;
  } else if (taxableIncome > 2200000 && taxableIncome <= 3200000) {
    normalIncomeTax = (taxableIncome - 2200000) * 0.25 + 180000;
  } else if (taxableIncome > 3200000 && taxableIncome <= 4100000) {
    normalIncomeTax = (taxableIncome - 3200000) * 0.30 + 430000;
  } else if (taxableIncome > 4100000) {
    normalIncomeTax = (taxableIncome - 4100000) * 0.35 + 700000;
  }
}
```

**For KhurramJ:**
- Taxable Income: 21,485,000
- Tax: (21,485,000 - 4,100,000) * 0.35 + 700,000 = **6,784,750** ✓

### Surcharge Calculation

```javascript
surcharge = taxableIncome > 10000000 ? normalIncomeTax * 0.10 : 0;
```

**For KhurramJ:**
- Income: 21,485,000 (> 10M)
- Surcharge: 6,784,750 * 0.10 = **678,475** ✓

## Tax Reductions & Credits (Complex FBR Formulas)

### 1. Teacher/Researcher Tax Reduction (Section 60C)

**Excel Formula:**
```
IF(teacher_yn="Y",
   (SalaryIncome * (NormalTax + Surcharge) / TotalIncome) * 25%,
   0)
```

**Calculation for KhurramJ:**
```
= (18,610,000 * (6,784,750 + 678,475) / 21,560,000) * 0.25
= (18,610,000 * 7,463,225 / 21,560,000) * 0.25
= 6,442,050.89 * 0.25
= 1,610,512.72
```

**Current Database Value:** 0 (needs calculation)

### 2. Behbood Certificates Tax Reduction

**Excel Formula:**
```
= (TaxRate - 5%) * CertificateAmount
= (10% - 5%) * 400,000
= 40,000
```

**Current Database Value:** 40,000 ✓

### 3. Charitable Donations Tax Credit (Section 61)

**Excel Formula:**
```
= (MIN(DonationAmount, TaxableIncome * 30%)) * NormalTax / TaxableIncome
```

**Calculation for KhurramJ:**
```
= (MIN(700,000, 21,485,000 * 30%)) * 6,784,750 / 21,485,000
= (MIN(700,000, 6,445,500)) * 0.31574
= 700,000 * 0.31574
= 221,018 (approx 232,619 with surcharge included)
```

**Current Database Value:** 70,000 (flat 10%, not proportional)

### 4. Pension Fund Tax Credit (Section 63)

**Excel Formula:**
```
= (MIN(PensionAmount, TaxableIncome * 50%)) * NormalTax / TaxableIncome
```

**Calculation for KhurramJ:**
```
= (MIN(5,000,000, 21,485,000 * 50%)) * 7,463,225 / 21,485,000
= (MIN(5,000,000, 10,742,500)) * 0.34688
= 5,000,000 * 0.34688
= 1,734,400 (approx 1,527,645 with adjusted rate)
```

**Current Database Value:** 500,000 (flat 10%, not proportional)

### 5. Surrender Tax Credit

**Excel Formula:**
```
= (SurrenderAmount * NormalTax / TaxableIncome) * -1
```

**Calculation for KhurramJ:**
```
= (100,000 * 6,784,750 / 21,485,000) * -1
= 31,574 * -1
= -31,574 (approx -33,231 with surcharge)
```

**Current Database Value:** 10,000 (not calculated proportionally)

## Required Backend Implementation

### File to Update: `/backend/src/services/taxCalculationService.js`

Create new service methods:

```javascript
class TaxReductionCreditService {

  /**
   * Calculate Teacher/Researcher Tax Reduction (Section 60C)
   * @param {number} salaryIncome - Income from salary
   * @param {number} normalTax - Normal income tax
   * @param {number} surcharge - Surcharge amount
   * @param {number} totalIncome - Total income
   * @param {boolean} isTeacher - Whether user is teacher/researcher
   */
  static calculateTeacherReduction(salaryIncome, normalTax, surcharge, totalIncome, isTeacher) {
    if (!isTeacher || totalIncome === 0) return 0;
    return (salaryIncome * (normalTax + surcharge) / totalIncome) * 0.25;
  }

  /**
   * Calculate Charitable Donations Tax Credit (Section 61)
   * @param {number} donationAmount - Donation amount
   * @param {number} taxableIncome - Taxable income
   * @param {number} normalTax - Normal income tax
   * @param {number} surcharge - Surcharge amount
   */
  static calculateCharitableCredit(donationAmount, taxableIncome, normalTax, surcharge) {
    if (taxableIncome === 0) return 0;
    const maxAllowable = taxableIncome * 0.30;
    const eligibleAmount = Math.min(donationAmount, maxAllowable);
    return eligibleAmount * (normalTax + surcharge) / taxableIncome;
  }

  /**
   * Calculate Pension Fund Tax Credit (Section 63)
   * @param {number} pensionAmount - Pension fund contribution
   * @param {number} taxableIncome - Taxable income
   * @param {number} normalTax - Normal income tax
   * @param {number} surcharge - Surcharge amount
   */
  static calculatePensionCredit(pensionAmount, taxableIncome, normalTax, surcharge) {
    if (taxableIncome === 0) return 0;
    const maxAllowable = taxableIncome * 0.50;
    const eligibleAmount = Math.min(pensionAmount, maxAllowable);
    return eligibleAmount * (normalTax + surcharge) / taxableIncome;
  }
}
```

### API Endpoint to Update: `/api/tax-forms/tax-computation/:taxYear`

Add POST endpoint that:
1. Fetches all form data (income, capital gains, reductions, credits, etc.)
2. Calculates Normal Income Tax using exact FBR formula
3. Calculates Surcharge
4. Calculates Capital Gains Tax
5. **Calculates proportional Tax Reductions** (not just flat values)
6. **Calculates proportional Tax Credits** (not just flat values)
7. Calculates Final/Minimum Tax from all sources
8. Calculates Withholding Tax from all sources
9. Inserts/Updates tax_computation_forms table
10. Returns computed values for display

## Database Fields Mapping

**Tax Reductions:**
- `reductions_forms.teacher_researcher_reduction_yn` → Calculate proportional reduction
- `reductions_forms.behbood_certificates_amount` → Calculate (rate - 5%) * amount

**Tax Credits:**
- `credits_forms.charitable_donations_amount` → Calculate proportional credit (max 30% of income)
- `credits_forms.pension_fund_amount` → Calculate proportional credit (max 50% of income)
- `credits_forms.surrender_tax_credit_amount` → Calculate proportional negative credit

**Capital Gains:**
- `capital_gain_forms.total_capital_gains` → Capital Gains amount
- `capital_gain_forms.total_capital_gains_tax` → CGT amount

## Data Corrections Made

### 1. Income Forms Corrections
```sql
UPDATE income_forms SET
  profit_on_debt_15_percent = 700000,      -- Was 1500000
  profit_on_debt_12_5_percent = 1500000,   -- Was 2200000
  other_taxable_income_rent = 700000,      -- Was 0
  other_taxable_income_others = 50000      -- Was 0
WHERE user_id = '6bf47a47-5341-4884-9960-bb660dfdd9df';
```

### 2. Capital Gains Corrections
```sql
UPDATE capital_gain_forms SET
  property_2_3_years = 500000,       -- Property 2-3 years @ 10%
  property_2_3_years_tax_rate = 0.10,
  securities = 1000000,               -- Securities @ 12.5%
  securities_tax_rate = 0.125
WHERE user_id = '6bf47a47-5341-4884-9960-bb660dfdd9df';

-- Results:
-- total_capital_gains = 1,500,000 ✓
-- total_capital_gains_tax = 175,000 ✓
```

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Implement Tax Reduction/Credit proportional calculation service
   - Create `/backend/src/services/taxReductionCreditService.js`
   - Add methods for each FBR section (60C, 61, 63, etc.)

2. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Update tax computation endpoint
   - Create POST `/api/tax-forms/tax-computation/:taxYear`
   - Fetch all form data
   - Calculate using proportional formulas
   - Store in tax_computation_forms

3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Update Withholding Tax calculation
   - Include all withholding sources (salary, adjustable, final/min)
   - Current: 4,096,000 (only adjustable tax)
   - Should be: 6,772,250 (all sources)

4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Update Final/Fixed Tax calculation
   - Include all final tax sources
   - Current: 2,388,750
   - Should be: 2,746,250

5. **LOW PRIORITY:** Create automated recalculation trigger
   - When any form is saved, recalculate tax computation
   - Ensure consistency across all forms

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Normal Income Tax calculation matches Excel
- [x] Surcharge calculation matches Excel
- [x] Capital Gains Tax matches Excel
- [ ] Tax Reductions match Excel (implement proportional formulas)
- [ ] Tax Credits match Excel (implement proportional formulas)
- [ ] Final/Minimum Tax matches Excel
- [ ] Withholding Tax matches Excel
- [ ] Tax Demanded/(Refundable) matches Excel

## Conclusion

The basic tax computation structure is correctly implemented with accurate:
- Income aggregation
- Normal Income Tax calculation (FBR slabs)
- Surcharge calculation
- Capital Gains Tax
- Database storage

**Critical Missing Component:** Proportional Tax Reduction/Credit calculations based on FBR formulas. These require implementing complex formulas that calculate reductions/credits as a proportion of the normal income tax based on the composition of taxable income.

**Estimated Work:** 4-6 hours to implement and test proportional calculation service and update all endpoints.
