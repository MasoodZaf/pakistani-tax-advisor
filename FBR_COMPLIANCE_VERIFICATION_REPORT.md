### Verification Tests

**Test Case 1: No Tax Zone**
```
Income: Rs 600,000
Expected Tax: Rs 0
Calculated Tax: Rs 0
Result: ✅ PASS
```

**Test Case 2: First Slab Upper Limit**
```
Income: Rs 1,200,000
Expected Tax: Rs 30,000 (600,000 × 5%)

Result: ✅ PASS
```

**Test Case 3: KhurramJ Test Case**
```
Income: Rs 21,485,000
Expected Tax: Rs 6,784,750
Formula: (21,485,000 - 4,100,000) × 35% + 700,000
        = 17,385,000 × 0.35 + 700,000
        = 6,084,750 + 700,000
        = 6,784,750
Calculated Tax: Rs 6,784,750
Result: ✅ PASS (Exact Match)
```

**Excel Formula Extracted:**
```excel
(IF((AND(B11>600000,B11<1200001)),((B11-600000))*5%,0))+
(IF((AND(B11>1200000,B11<2200001)),((B11-1200000)*15%)+30000,0))+
(IF((AND(B11>2200000,B11<3200001)),((B11-2200000)*25%)+180000,0))+
(IF((AND(B11>3200000,B11<4100001)),((B11-3200000)*30%)+430000,0))+
(IF(B11>4100000,((B11-4100000)*35%)+700000,0))
```

**Our SQL Implementation:**
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION calculate_normal_income_tax(taxable_income NUMERIC)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
BEGIN
    IF taxable_income <= 600000 THEN
        RETURN 0;
    ELSIF taxable_income <= 1200000 THEN
        RETURN (taxable_income - 600000) * 0.05;
    ELSIF taxable_income <= 2200000 THEN
        RETURN (taxable_income - 1200000) * 0.15 + 30000;
    ELSIF taxable_income <= 3200000 THEN
        RETURN (taxable_income - 2200000) * 0.25 + 180000;
    ELSIF taxable_income <= 4100000 THEN
        RETURN (taxable_income - 3200000) * 0.30 + 430000;
    ELSE

```

### Implementation
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION calculate_teacher_reduction(
    salary_income NUMERIC,
    normal_tax NUMERIC,

    END IF;
    RETURN 0;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql IMMUTABLE;
```

### KhurramJ Verification
```
Salary Income:    Rs 18,610,000
Normal Tax:       Rs  6,784,750
Surcharge:        Rs    678,475
Total Income:     Rs 21,560,000

Calculation:
= (18,610,000 × (6,784,750 + 678,475) / 21,560,000) × 0.25
= (18,610,000 × 7,463,225 / 21,560,000) × 0.25
= 6,442,050.89 × 0.25

Excel Result:     Rs 1,610,512.72
Our Result:       Rs 1,610,512.72
Difference:       Rs 0.00
```
