## RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority
1. **Fix Income Form API Endpoint**
   - Route `/api/income-tax/income/:taxYear` returns 404
   - Verify route configuration in `backend/src/modules/IncomeTax/index.js`
   - Expected: Should return income form data for authenticated user

2. **Implement Wealth Statement API**
   - Wealth Statement module is skeleton only (`backend/src/modules/WealthStatement/index.js`)
   - Need to create routes for:
     - GET `/api/wealth-statement/form/:taxYear`
     - POST `/api/wealth-statement/form/:taxYear`

### Medium Priority
3. **Fix Current Tax Return API Response**
   - Endpoint exists but returns no data despite tax return existing in database
   - Review response mapping in `backend/src/modules/IncomeTax/routes/taxForms.js:9`

4. **Implement Reports API Endpoints**
   - Reports module exists but tax-summary endpoint not found
   - Review `backend/src/routes/reports.js` for missing routes
   - Add authentication middleware if missing

### Low Priority
5. **API Documentation**
   - Document all working API endpoints
   - Create Postman collection for testing
   - Add API versioning strategy

6. **Test Data Management**
   - Create automated test data population scripts
   - Add database seeders for different test scenarios
   - Implement test data cleanup procedures
