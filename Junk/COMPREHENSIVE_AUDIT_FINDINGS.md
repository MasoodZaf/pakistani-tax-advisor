## 🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### High Priority (Fix before production)
None - Application is production ready

### Medium Priority (Fix within 1 week)
1. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   ```javascript
   // Add to app.js
   const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
   const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
     max: 5, // limit each IP to 5 requests per windowMs
     message: 'Too many login attempts, try again later'
   });
   app.use('/api/login', loginLimiter);
   ```

2. **Replace console.log with logger**
   - Files: `/routes/auth.js`, `/routes/admin.js`, `/routes/reports.js`

3. **Tighten CORS policy for production**
   ```javascript
   // Update CORS configuration
   app.use(cors({
     origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
     credentials: true
   }));
   ```

### Low Priority (Fix within 1 month)
1. Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation
2. Remove unused imports and code
3. Implement API response caching
4. Add request logging middleware
